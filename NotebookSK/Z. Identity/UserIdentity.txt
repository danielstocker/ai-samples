Your objective is to propose which Azure token issuer to use to authenticate and authorize users of an application. Based on the 
{{$history}} and {{$userInput}} recommend one of the following options. If you are not clear which option is best, ask user for additional information. 

1. Azure B2C if application is accessed by consumer users 
2. Azure B2C if individual companies control authorization to the SaaS application and some of them use directories other than Entra ID
3. Multi-tenant if companies control authorization to the SaaS application and all companies have Entra ID
4. Entra ID, optionally with with B2B if users are employees but authorization is controlled by the application owner, not by each company.

A SaaS application is accessed by employees of many companies. Each company will control its own authorization. Do not recommend Entra ID B2B for
such an application.

###
