## Questions

1. What is the role of the modelId parameter in AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion or 
WithAzureOpenAITextEmbeddingGeneration APIs?
2. I would like to use some text files (md) to augment my model for ChatCompletion-type
operations (use prompt to get information). For that I (think) I need a GTP model. I see from the samples that
I can add such files to ISemanticMemory objects but these require a Text Embedding base model. Is
there a way to use the memory for chat completion or am I barking up the wrong tree?
